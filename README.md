# WordNet-Affect-UKR
WordNet-Affect (http://wndomains.fbk.eu/wnaffect.html) is an extension of WordNet Domains, including a subset of synsets suitable to represent affective concepts correlated with affective words.
In this resource synsets (a set of synonyms) of verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, which describe emotions, were manually marked by special emotional tags (affective labels, A-labels). These emotional tags characterize various states expressing moods, emotional responses, or situations which cause emotions.
WordNet-Affect contains 1,903 concepts related to mental or emotional condition. WordNet-Affect produces an additional hierarchy of the affective domain labels, independent from the domain hierarchy, wherewith the synsets that represent affective concepts are annotated. “Affective words” are considered to be words that have “emotional connotation”. There are words that not only describe directly some emotions (for example, joy, sad or scare) but also are related to emotions like words describing mental states, physical or bodily states, personality traits, behaviours, attitudes, and feelings (such as pleasure or pain).
We have expanded WordNet-Affect dictionary from the Technical University of Moldova and added the Ukrainian language. Current version of Ukrainian WordNet-Affect consists of six files: anger.txt, disgust.txt, fear.txt, joy.txt, sadness.txt, surprise.txt and contains 2,874 synsets (4,787 words).
